# 2 — Product Research Framework + Ranked Shortlist

## Selection Criteria Checklist

Score each product concept 1–5 on every criterion (5 = best).

| Criterion | What to evaluate |
|-----------|-----------------|
| **Margin** | Landed cost vs $29–$49 retail. Target ≥ 50% gross margin |
| **Refill/Reorder Rate** | Does the product get consumed or wear out? Monthly or bi-monthly repurchase? |
| **Weight/Shipping Risk** | Under 1 lb ideally. Avoid liquids/glass/batteries in shipping |
| **Chargeback Risk** | Is the product easy to verify delivery? Low "item not as described" risk? |
| **Return Rate Risk** | Subjective products (fit, fragrance) return more. Simple consumables return less |
| **Differentiation** | Can you position it differently without copying a trademark? |
| **Ad Angle** | Can you make a scroll-stopping claim that is 100% safe (no health cure claims)? |
| **Supplier Availability** | Available on AliExpress, CJDropshipping, Spocket, or US-based wholesalers? |
| **Competitive Pressure** | Avoid oversaturated categories (phone cases, generic supplements) |
| **Legal / Import Risk** | No FDA-regulated drug claims, no CPSC hazards, no age-gating |

## Best Pick: #1 — Daily Foaming Facial Wash Refill Pods

### Why This Wins

1. **Highest true refill cadence** — one pod per day means a 6-pack lasts ~30 days. That maps perfectly to a monthly subscription/remind-to-reorder email.
2. **No liquid-shipping risk** — pods are dry/semi-solid and ship as a small lightweight parcel (< 0.3 lb for 6-pack).
3. **Zero-waste positioning** — the "refill pod" angle is genuinely novel and resonates with the dominant skincare + sustainability trend without copying any existing brand.
4. **Safe ad angles exist** — "foam without the bottle", "travel-friendly", "eco skincare routine" are all compliant claims. No health cure language needed.
5. **Wide supplier availability** — dozens of private-label pod manufacturers on CJDropshipping and AliExpress with MOQ 1 (dropship) or MOQ 50–100 for white-labeling.
6. **Strong hero visual** — a single pod dissolving into lather is a naturally satisfying 5-second video loop.
