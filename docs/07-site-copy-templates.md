### Product FAQs

**Q: Is this safe for sensitive skin?**
A: Our formula is dermatologically tested and free of parabens, sulfates (SLS/SLES), and artificial dyes. We recommend a patch test on the inside of your wrist if you have a known skin sensitivity.

**Q: Does it replace my current cleanser?**
A: Many customers use it as a complete replacement. It's designed to be a full facial wash — not a supplement to one. Of course, every skin type is different.

**Q: How long does one pod last?**
A: One pod is designed for one full facial wash. If you have a larger surface area or prefer a heavier lather, you may use two pods.

**Q: Are the wrappers really biodegradable?**
A: Yes. The individual pod wrappers are made from PVA (polyvinyl alcohol), which dissolves completely in water and breaks down naturally.

**Q: How do I store them?**
A: Store pods in a cool, dry place. Avoid humidity, which can cause the wrapper to dissolve prematurely. Our Travel Pod Case (sold separately) is perfect for this.
