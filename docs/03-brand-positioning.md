# 3 — Brand & Positioning

## Brand Name Ideas

| # | Name | Why It Works |
|---|------|-------------|
| 1 | **LatherLoop** | "Lather" = the act of washing; "Loop" = the daily ritual and the zero-waste circular concept |
| 2 | DropFresh | Clean/simple; "drop" echoes the pod format |
| 3 | PodPure | Alliterative; signals purity and the pod format |
| 4 | RefillRitual | Explains the replenishment model in the name |
| 5 | FoamForm | Playful; the pod "forms" the foam |

### ✅ Chosen: **LatherLoop**

Short, memorable, .com available (verify before launch), communicates the daily habit loop and the eco-refill concept without over-explaining.

## Tagline

> **"Your daily ritual, simplified."**

Secondary taglines for A/B testing:
- "One pod. One perfect wash."
- "Less bottle. More you."
- "The cleanest routine on the planet."

## Brand Voice (3 Bullets)

1. **Warm and approachable** — we talk to our customers like a knowledgeable friend, not a corporate brand. No jargon, no fear-based messaging.
2. **Quietly confident** — we let the product's simplicity speak. Short sentences. No exclamation-point spam. We don't hype; we explain.
3. **Purposefully eco** — sustainability is woven in naturally, not performatively. We cite real numbers (e.g., "skip 300 plastic bottles a year") rather than vague green claims.
