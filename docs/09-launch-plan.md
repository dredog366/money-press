## 30-Day Growth Plan

### Organic Content Cadence

| Platform | Frequency | Content Types |
|----------|-----------|---------------|
| Instagram Reels | 4×/week | Pod dissolving, skincare routine, UGC reposts, "did you know?" |
| Instagram Feed | 3×/week | Product flat lays, lifestyle shots, testimonial graphics |
| TikTok | Daily | Short-form (8–15 sec): satisfying pod foam, GRWM clips, routine hacks |
| Pinterest | 3×/week | Product pins with keywords, lifestyle boards |
| Email newsletter | 1×/week | Tips, refill reminder, product feature, social proof |

**Content pillar rotation (repeat weekly):**
1. **Product** — show the pod, how it works, what's in the box
2. **Lifestyle** — morning routines, travel, clean beauty aesthetics
3. **Social proof** — customer reviews, UGC, testimonials
4. **Education** — skincare tips, ingredient info, eco-consciousness
5. **Promotion** — weekly offer, bundle deals, urgency

### Paid Test Plan ($5–$20/day)

| Week | Budget/day | Platform | Objective | Audience |
|------|-----------|----------|-----------|---------|
| 1–2 | $10 | Meta | Purchase | US women 25–45, skincare interests |
| 1–2 | $5 | TikTok | Video views / traffic | US broad, 18–45 |
| 3–4 | $15 | Meta | Purchase | Lookalike 1% of purchasers |
| 3–4 | $10 | Meta | Retarget | Add-to-cart, product viewers (last 14 days) |
| 4+ | Scale winner | Meta | Purchase | Scale winning ad set 20%/day |

**Spend Rule:** Never scale an ad set more than 20% per day. If ROAS drops below 1.5×, pause and iterate creative.

### Creative Testing Matrix

| Variable | Variant A | Variant B | Winner criteria |
|----------|-----------|-----------|----------------|
| Hook (first 3 sec) | Pod dissolving close-up | Hand holding pod before foam | CTR ≥ 2.5% |
| Copy angle | "Zero plastic bottle" | "One pod = one perfect wash" | ROAS ≥ 2× |
| CTA | "Shop Now" | "Try the Starter Pack" | CVR on landing page |
| Format | 9:16 vertical video | 1:1 square video | CPM comparison |
| Audience | Women 25–35 | Women 35–50 | CPP comparison |

Test one variable at a time. Run each test for at least 3 days and $30 spend before drawing conclusions.
